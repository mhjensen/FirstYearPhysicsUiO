<h2 id="___sec4">Revised first year </h2>

<p>
The department of Mathematics is planning a revision of the content of
MAT1100 and MAT1110. The most likely scenario is that the basic
content will not deviate too much from the above. The learning
otucomes of the programming course IN1900 are also expected to remain
the same.

<p>
This opens up for a coherent first year in Physics and Astronomy where
the aim is to integrate theory, computations and experiments in a
coherent way, including much of the same mathematical and
computational aspects included in MAT-INF1100 and MEK1100 but now
tailored to a Physics and Astronomy perspective, with a strong focus
on an overarching understanding of the scientific method and its
various elements.

<p>
All three new courses will include experiments which canbe integrated
with a numerical perspective using applications on smartphones and
kits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target="_blank">Arduino</a>.  A
central benefit here is that students can carry out experiments at
home or outside a standard lab environment. Furthermore, the
integration of experiments with a programming perspectives allows
students to carry out experiments and upload data to their computing
devices (laptops/PCs/Tablets) for further analyses, interpretations and discussions.

<p>
To achieve this integration, we propose three new courses

<ol>
<li> FYS11XX Mechanics and Modeling</li>
<li> FYS12XX Classical Mechanics</li>
<li> FYS13XX Statistics, probability and data analysis for physicists</li>
</ol>

The possible content is described below. 
The first year of study could then look like this if we aim at keeping courses of 10 ECTS. There is also the possibility to modularize these topics in units of 5 ECTS or 7.5 ECTS.
