<h2 id="___sec0">Introduction and Motivation </h2>

<p>
Students of the Physics and Astronomy bachelor program as well as
faculty at the department of Physics (DP) and Institute of Theoretical
Astrophysics (ITA) have often remarked that there is a lack of Physics
topics in the first year of study, and in particular during the first
semester.

<p>
The setup of the first year of study is also essentially the same
since the fall semester of 2003, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process" target="_blank">Bologna process</a>
(<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvalitetsreformen" target="_blank">Kvalitetsreformen</a>) was introduced in Norway.

<p>
Moreover, during the
last decade we have seen several changes in competences and skills of the
incoming students as well as improved computational and experimental
software and hardware. In addition, pedagogical research and technological
innovations with respect to alternative ways of organizing lectures
such as flipped classrooms and more, are all topics we believe should
be reflected in the way we organize our bachelor program and higher education in
Physics and Astronomy. With the center of excellence in higher education <b>Center for Computing in Science Education</b>, we have also the possibility to accompany pedagogical changes with ongoing and future  research programs on university education.

<p>
We propose here 
a novel and new first year in Physics and Astronomy where
the aim is to integrate theory, computations and experiments in a
coherent way, including much of the same mathematical and
computational aspects included in MAT-INF1100 and MEK1100 but now
tailored to a Physics and Astronomy perspective, with a strong focus
on an overarching understanding of the scientific method and its
various elements from day one.
We propose three new courses, with a great potential for pedagogical innovations and pedagogical research as well.
These courses are integrated with central first year courses in Mathematics and Computing.

<p>
All three new courses include experiments which can be integrated
with a numerical perspective using applications on smartphones and
hardware like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target="_blank">Arduino</a>.  A
central benefit here is that students can carry out experiments at
home or outside a standard lab environment. Furthermore, the
integration of experiments with a programming perspective allows
students to carry out experiments and upload data to their computing
devices (laptops/PCs/Tablets) for further analyses, interpretations
and discussions.  To strengthen the understanding of Physics being an
experimental discipline we introduce also a new course on Statistics,
Probability and Data Analysis for Physicists in the second
semester. This course aims at a more coherent introduction of central
elements from statistics needed in theoretical and experimental
studies.

<p>
The slides for the presentation during the meeting of October 15 are here <a href="https://mhjensen.github.io/FirstYearPhysicsUiO/doc/pub/slides/html/slides-reveal.html" target="_blank"><tt>https://mhjensen.github.io/FirstYearPhysicsUiO/doc/pub/slides/html/slides-reveal.html</tt></a>

<h2 id="___sec1">Present situation with description of courses, bachelor degree in Physics and Astronomy  </h2>

<p>
All courses are scaled to ten ECTS (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/education/resources-and-tools/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system-ects_en" target="_blank">European Credit Transfer and Accumulation  System</a>).

</ol>

<h2 id="___sec4">Revised first year </h2>

<p>
The department of Mathematics is planning a revision of the content of
MAT1100 and MAT1110. The most likely scenario is that the basic
content will not deviate too much from the above. The learning
otucomes of the programming course IN1900 are also expected to remain
the same.

<p>
We think it is important that the department of Physics  and ITA perform a
careful review and eventual revision of the scientific and pedagogical
content of the bachelor program in Physics and Astronomy.  In this
conncetion we would like to advocate for a coherent first year in
Physics and Astronomy where the aim is to integrate theory,
computations and experiments in a coherent way, including much of the
same mathematical and computational aspects included in MAT-INF1100
and MEK1100 but now tailored to a Physics and Astronomy perspective,
with a strong focus on an overarching understanding of the scientific
method and its various elements.

<p>
All three new courses will include experiments which can be integrated
with a numerical perspective using applications on smartphones and
kits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target="_blank">Arduino</a>.  A
central benefit here is that students can carry out experiments at
home or outside a standard lab environment. Furthermore, the
integration of experiments with a programming perspectives allows
students to carry out experiments and upload data to their computing
devices (laptops/PCs/Tablets) for further analyses, interpretations and discussions.

<p>
To achieve this integration, we propose three new courses

<ol>
<li> FYS111X Mechanics and Modeling</li>
<li> FYS112X Classical Mechanics</li>
<li> FYS113X Statistics, probability and data analysis for physicists</li>
</ol>

The possible content is described below. 
The first year of study could then look like this if we aim at keeping courses of 10 ECTS. There is also the possibility to modularize these topics in units of 5 ECTS or 7.5 ECTS.

<h2 id="___sec5">Specific content of new courses </h2>

<h3 id="___sec6">FYS111X Mechanics and Modeling </h3>

<p>
The Mechanics and Modeling course integrates central elements from MAT-INF1100 and FYS-MEK1100. The basic Mechanics content from FYS-MEK1100 is kept, that is we focus on elementary Newtonian mechanics  and students will (optimally covered by chapters 1-13 of Malthe-S&#248;renssen)

<ul>
 <li> be able to analyze forces that act on objects, apply Newton&#8217;s laws to determine the equations of motion, and solve these both analytically and numerically;</li>
 <li> be able to apply conservation laws for mechanical energy, momentum, and angular momentum to solve static and dynamic problems and to analyze collisions between bodies.</li>
</ul>

These concepts will be integrated with a computational approach where central algorithms for solving equations of motion are introduced. This includes elements from MAT-INF1100 central to studies of differential equations and numerical solutions of integrals.  To be more explicit this means that the students 

<ul>
 <li> are familiar with the basic properties of integer and real numbers, how they are represented in a computer, and limitations of the representations;</li>
 <li> can find formulas for the solution of some difference and differential equations;</li>
 <li> are familiar with and can program numerical methods for approximate calculation of the derivative and the integral of general functions, as well as approximate solutions of equations, difference equations and differential equations;</li>
 <li> are familiar with the general limitations of numerical models for solving differential equations and integrals. Central methods for solving differential equations are the family of Euler- and modified Euler methods, the Velocity Verlet method and the family of Runge-Kutta methods. For integrals, standard Newton-Cotes quadrature methods like the midpoint rule, the Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule will be presented.</li> 
 <li> can derive simple mathematical models for practical problems using derivatives, integrals and different kinds of equations;</li>
</ul>

In addition this course will include a set of selected simple experiments using the accelerometer on a standard smartphone. Students will then transfer the data to their own laptops/PCs/Tablets and perform a final analysis of the data such as calculating the velocity and the position based on the measured acceleration. The uncertainties with the measurements will be addressed in the second semester in the course FYS113X.

<p>
This course is integrated with IN1900 and MAT1100.

<h3 id="___sec7">FYS112X Classical Mechanics </h3>

<p>
This course is a continuation of FYS111X and includes more
advanced topics tailored explicitely to Physics and Astronomy students. The
integration of central theoretical, computational and experimental elements as well as a coordination
with FYS113X and MAT1110 plays an important role. In addition to more advanced topics in mechanics not discussed in FYS-MEK1100, this course includes elements from MEK1100.

<p>
Possible topics are

<ul>
<li> Repetition of central elements from FYS111X, Newton's laws, conservation laws and solutions of equations of motion, analytically and numerically</li>
<li> Variational and Lagrangian Calculus with examples and derivation of equations of motion</li>
<li> Two-body problems and central forces, Kepler's laws, Gravitational problems, classical two-body scattering</li>
<li> Oscillations, Driven and damped oscillations, coupled oscillations and Fourier series. Numerical and analytical solutions of equations of motion.</li>
<li> Mechanics and Equations of motion in non-inertial frames, accelerating and rotating frames, Coriolis and Centrifugal forces. Numerical and analytical solutions of equations of motion.</li>
<li> Rigid body kinematics and Dynamics. Numerical and analytical solutions of equations of motion.</li>
<li> Special Relativity</li>
<li> Tentative (could also be deferred to FYS3120) Hamilton's principle and Hamiltonian mechanics. Understanding important symplectic differential equations and energy conservation.</li>
<li> Continuum mechanics with wave equation, stress and strain tensor, Hooke's law and equations of motion for an elastic solid</li>
<li> Basic elements from fluid mechanics, mass conservation equation and the equation of motion of fluids, Bernoulli&#180;s equation for stationary ideal liquid flow, heat and temperature computations with convection and Fourier&#180;s law.</li> 
<li> Knowledge of scaling, the significance of physical units and dimensionless parameters</li>
<li> Gradient and directional derivative, divergence and curl, equiscalar surfaces, field lines, curve integrals and circulation, surface integrals and flux, pressure force, particle derivative, in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates, and have knowledge of the physical interpretation of these quantities</li>
<li> Basic understanding of Gauss and Stokes theorems in mechanics examples</li>
<li> can use the computer to visualize scalar and vector fields and to do numerical computations of fields</li>
<li> <b>Discuss which experiments to include</b>! See also next course.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec8">FYS113X Statistics, probability and data analysis for physicists </h3>

<p>
These topics have normally been taught in a scattered way in different
courses. This means that the students are never exposed to a coherent
view on central elements of probability theory, statistics and data
analysis. The results is often a lack of understanding of central
elements in the analysis of experimental and theoretical data. The aim
here is to establish such a course, integrating the needed statistical
theory with computations and analysis of theoretical simulations and
experimental results. Moreover, it allows us to focus on central
aspects of data analysis with emphasis on  physics and astronomy and simpler machine learning
algorithms. Central topics are

<ol>
<li> Basic concepts</li>

<ul>
 <li> Randomness and probability, basic principles</li>
 <li> Distributions, moments and errors. Central concepts like moments, errors and essential distributions (Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, uniform, exponential, log-normal etc), central limit theorem</li>
</ul>

<li> Distributions in the physical world</li>

<ul>
 <li> Distributions in the physical world, examples from different types of experiments</li>
 <li> Confidence intervals</li>
 <li> Statistics with binomial, Poisson and Gaussian distributions</li>
 <li> Random processes and distributions arising from these</li>
 <li> Random numbers and Monte Carlo methods</li>
</ul>

<li> Probabilistic inference</li>

<ul>
 <li> Hypothesis testing and Bayesian approach to probability</li>
 <li> Parameter estimation</li>
 <li> Correlation testing and covariance</li>
 <li> Computations and model fitting</li>
</ul>

<li> Frequentist inference and simple Machine Learning algorithms</li>

<ul>
 <li> Linear and Logistic regression, regression and classification problems</li>
 <li> Decision trees and Random forests</li>
 <li> Simple Neural networks</li>
</ul>

</ol>

Need to discuss which experiments we can do that can be integrated
with FYS113X.  A dedicated workshop which addresses possible
experiments in FYS111X, FYS112X and FYS113X is planned for fall (late)
2020.

<h2 id="___sec9">Coordination with other programs </h2>

<p>
The course FYS-MEK1100 has also served as a recommened or compulsory course in other bachelor of science programs. These are the

<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/elektronikk-it/oppbygging/" target="_blank">Electronics, informatics and Technology, fourth semester</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/geofysikk/oppbygging/" target="_blank">Geophysics and Climate, second semester</a>o <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/geologi/oppbygging/" target="_blank">Geology and Geography, second semester</a>   o <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/matematikk-informatikk/studieretninger/matematikk-fysikk/oppbygging/" target="_blank">Mathematics and Physics, fourth semester</a></li> 
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/matematikk-informatikk/studieretninger/mekanikk-teknologi/oppbygging/" target="_blank">Mechanics and technology, fourth semester</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/materialvitenskap/oppbygging/" target="_blank">Materials science, second semester</a></li>
<li> Educational Master program (Lektorprogrammet).</li>
</ol>

An alternative here is that the new course FYS111X is offered both
during the fall and during the spring semester. Physics and
Astronomy students will follow the fall variant while the other
educational programs are offered the spring variant. FYS111X has to a
large extent many of the same central elements included in
FYS-MEK1100.

<p>
A careful revision may however be needed in order to accomodate the needs of these other programs.

<h2 id="___sec10">Education Research and Innovation </h2>

<p>
What is presented above aims at innovating the way we teach physics,
integrating concepts and topics normally scattered across many
different (and often disconnected) university courses and  opening up
also for innovative approaches to university education and studies.

<p>
The overarching motivation is to allow for a deeper
understanding of the scientific method at an earlier stage in our
education by integrating theory, experiments and computations. This has the potential
to elucidate essential stages of the scientific process.

<p>
There are several other interesting aspects which can define new
educational research projects, in particular an integration of flipped
classrooms that normally allow for a tighter connection between
students and teachers (faculty, learning assistants and teaching
assistants).

<p>
Exploring flipped classrooms may involve the development of new
digital learning material of high quality, such as videos, podcasts
and improved learning material. This could also include developing or
adapting curricula and learning objectives that are meaningful in
online settings.

<p>
Integrating thus the introduction of a new first year for the Physics
and Astronomy program with existing and planned research in close
collaboration with the Center for Computing in Science Education has
the potential to improve considerably the quality of our education. At
present, there are no Physics undergraduate programs (to our
knowledge) which integrate from day one theory, computations and
experiments.  As such, this proposal brings the Computing in Science
Education initiative (which started with the reform in 2003) to a
higher and new level.
