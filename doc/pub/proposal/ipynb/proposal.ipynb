    "\n",
    "Students of the Physics and Astronomy bachelor program as well as\n",
    "faculty at the department of Physics (DP) and Institute of Theoretical\n",
    "Astrophysics (ITA) have often remarked that there is a lack of Physics\n",
    "topics in the first year of study, and in particular during the first\n",
    "semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of the first year of study is also essentially the same\n",
    "since the fall semester of 2003, when the [Bologna process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process)\n",
    "([Kvalitetsreformen](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvalitetsreformen)) was introduced in Norway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, during the\n",
    "last decade we have seen several changes in competences and skills of the\n",
    "incoming students as well as improved computational and experimental\n",
    "software and hardware. In addition, pedagogical research and technological\n",
    "innovations with respect to alternative ways of organizing lectures\n",
    "such as flipped classrooms and more, are all topics we believe should\n",
    "be reflected in the way we organize our bachelor program and higher education in\n",
    "Physics and Astronomy. With the center of excellence in higher education **Center for Computing in Science Education**, we have also the possibility to accompany pedagogical changes with ongoing and future  research programs on university education. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose here \n",
    "a novel and new first year in Physics and Astronomy where\n",
    "the aim is to integrate theory, computations and experiments in a\n",
    "coherent way, including much of the same mathematical and\n",
    "computational aspects included in MAT-INF1100 and MEK1100 but now\n",
    "tailored to a Physics and Astronomy perspective, with a strong focus\n",
    "on an overarching understanding of the scientific method and its\n",
    "various elements from day one.\n",
    "We propose three new courses, with a great potential for pedagogical innovations and pedagogical research as well.\n",
    "These courses are integrated with central first year courses in Mathematics and Computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All three new courses include experiments which can be integrated\n",
    "with a numerical perspective using applications on smartphones and\n",
    "hardware like [Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino).  A\n",
    "central benefit here is that students can carry out experiments at\n",
    "home or outside a standard lab environment. Furthermore, the\n",
    "integration of experiments with a programming perspective allows\n",
    "students to carry out experiments and upload data to their computing\n",
    "devices (laptops/PCs/Tablets) for further analyses, interpretations\n",
    "and discussions.  To strengthen the understanding of Physics being an\n",
    "experimental discipline we introduce also a new course on Statistics,\n",

    "\n",
    "The Mechanics and Modeling course integrates central elements from MAT-INF1100 and FYS-MEK1100. The basic Mechanics content from FYS-MEK1100 is kept, that is we focus on elementary Newtonian mechanics  and students will (optimally covered by chapters 1-13 of Malthe-Sørenssen)\n",

    " * be able to analyze forces that act on objects, apply Newton’s laws to determine the equations of motion, and solve these both analytically and numerically;\n",
    "\n",
    " * be able to apply conservation laws for mechanical energy, momentum, and angular momentum to solve static and dynamic problems and to analyze collisions between bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will be integrated with a computational approach where central algorithms for solving equations of motion are introduced. This includes elements from MAT-INF1100 central to studies of differential equations and numerical solutions of integrals.  To be more explicit this means that the students \n",
    " * are familiar with the basic properties of integer and real numbers, how they are represented in a computer, and limitations of the representations;\n",
    "\n",
    " * can find formulas for the solution of some difference and differential equations;\n",

    "\n",
    " * are familiar with the general limitations of numerical models for solving differential equations and integrals. Central methods for solving differential equations are the family of Euler- and modified Euler methods, the Velocity Verlet method and the family of Runge-Kutta methods. For integrals, standard Newton-Cotes quadrature methods like the midpoint rule, the Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule will be presented. \n",
    "\n",
    " * can derive simple mathematical models for practical problems using derivatives, integrals and different kinds of equations;\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition this course will include a set of selected simple experiments using the accelerometer on a standard smartphone. Students will then transfer the data to their own laptops/PCs/Tablets and perform a final analysis of the data such as calculating the velocity and the position based on the measured acceleration. The uncertainties with the measurements will be addressed in the second semester in the course FYS113X. \n",
