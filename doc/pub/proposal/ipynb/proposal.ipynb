    "\n",
    "The Mechanics and Modeling course integrates central elements from MAT-INF1100 and FYS-MEK1100. The basic Mechanics content from FYS-MEK1100 is kept, that is we focus on elementary Newtonian mechanics  and students will (optimally covered by chapters 1-13 of Malthe-Sørenssen)\n",

    " * be able to apply conservation laws for mechanical energy, momentum, and angular momentum to solve static and dynamic problems and to analyze collisions between bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will be integrated with a computational approach where central algorithms for solving equations of motion of motion are introduced. This includes elements from MAT-INF1100 central to studies of differential equations and numerical solutions of integrals.  To be more explicit this means that the students \n",
    " * are familiar with the basic properties of integer and real numbers, how they are represented in a computer, and limitations of the representations;\n",

    " * can find formulas for the solution of some difference and differential equations;\n",

    "\n",
    " * are familiar with the general limitations of numerical models for solving differential equations and integrals. Central methods for solving differential equations are the family of Euler- and modified Euler methods, the Velocity Verlet method and the family of Runge-Kutta methods. For integrals, standard Newton-Cotes quadrature methods like the midpoint rule, the Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule will be presented. \n",
    "\n",
    " * can derive simple mathematical models for practical problems using derivatives, integrals and different kinds of equations;\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition this course will include a set of selected simple experiments using the accelerometer on a standard smartphone. Students will then transfer the data to their own laptops/PCs/Tablets and perform a final analysis of the data such as calculating the velocity and the position based on the measured acceleration. The uncertainties with the measurements will be addressed in the second semester in the course FYS13XX. \n",
