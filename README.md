## First Year Physics and Astronomy program at the University of Oslo


The documents here present  a coherent first year in Physics and Astronomy where
the aim is to integrate theory, computations and experiments in a
coherent way, including much of the same mathematical and
computational aspects included in MAT-INF1100 and MEK1100 but now
tailored to a Physics and Astronomy perspective, with a strong focus
on an overarching understanding of the scientific method and its
various elements.
